Loved the series! I was hoping for another season.  Who would have thought the game of chess was so interesting outside of chess club?

It seems as Anya Taylor-Joy is able to transform into any character.  She was so interesting as Emma in the British aristocracy role this  year.  Equally surprising, when I discovered her in this limited series as an American Chess prodigy.  

While one may view Beth Harmon as deeply flawed, it should be noted that it was only through growing pains of a life planned, that she ultimately triumphed.  

As a side note, I was routing for her and Harry.  

Well done Anya Taylor-Joy!
